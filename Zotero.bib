The book provides a broad understanding of the models and their uses. After presenting the basic model formulation, the book covers estimation, forecasting, decoding, prediction, model selection, and Bayesian inference for HMMs. Through examples and applications, the authors describe how to extend and generalize the basic model so that it can be applied in a rich variety of situations. The book demonstrates how HMMs can be applied to a wide range of types of time series: continuous-valued, circular, multivariate, binary, bounded and unbounded counts, and categorical observations. It also discusses how to employ the freely available computing environment R to carry out the computations. Features  Presents an accessible overview of HMMs Explores a variety of applications in ecology, finance, epidemiology, climatology, and sociology Includes numerous theoretical and programming exercises Provides most of the analysed data sets online New to the second edition  A total of five chapters on extensions, including HMMs for longitudinal data, hidden semi-Markov models and models with continuous-valued state process New case studies on animal movement, rainfall occurrence and capture–recapture data},

At the heart of this work, we emphasize (1) that for our goals, hybrid systems can be approximated as Markov Decision Processes, (2) that although corresponding Markov chains may include a very large number of discrete states, much of their dynamic behavior is well-characterized simply by the secondlargest eigenvalue, which is directly analogous to a dominant pole for a discrete-time system and describes both the mean and higher-order modes of the escape statistics, and (3) that for many systems, one can accurately describe initial conditions as being rapidly forgotten, due to a signiﬁcant separation in slow and fast decay rates. We present both theory and intuitive toy examples that illustrate our approach in analyzing such systems, toward enabling and encouraging other researchers to adopt similar methods.},

In many such applications, an analysis of clustering behaviour in the states of the system is desirable, and it is well-known that the eigendecomposition of the transition matrix A of the Markov chain can provide such insight. Clustering methods based on the sign pattern in the second eigenvector of A are frequently used when A has dominant eigenvalues that are real. In this paper, we present a method to include an analysis for complex eigenvalues of A which are close to 1. Since a real spectrum is not guaranteed in most applications, this is a valuable result in the area of spectral clustering in Markov chains.},

Emphasis is placed here on the evaluation of forecast quality with the Energy score, which is based on a quadratic scoring rule.

For the case of multivariate Gaussian process, a theoretical upper for such discrimination ability is derived and discussed. This limited discrimination ability may eventually get compromised by computational and sampling issues, as dimension increases.},

To account for the uncertainty in predicting wind power production, this article examines the volatility forecasting abilities of different GARCH-type models for wind power production. Moreover, due to characteristic features of the wind power process, such as heteroscedasticity and nonlinearity, we also investigate the use of a Markov regime-switching GARCH (MRS-GARCH) model on forecasting volatility of wind power. The realized volatility, which is derived from lower-scale data, serves as a benchmark for the latent volatility. We find that the MRS-GARCH model significantly outperforms traditional GARCH models in predicting the volatility of wind power, while the exponential GARCH model is superior among traditional GARCH models.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a very tractable approach to modeling changes in regime. The parameters of an autoregression are viewed as the outcome of a discrete-state Markov process. For example, the mean growth rate of a nonstationary series may be subject to occasional, discrete shifts. The econometrician is presumed not to observe these shifts directly, but instead must draw probabilistic inference about whether and when they may have occurred based on the observed behavior of the series. The paper presents an algorithm for drawing such probabilistic inference in the form of a nonlinear iterative filter. The filter also permits estimation of population parameters by the method of maximum likelihood and provides the foundation for forecasting future values of the series. An empirical application of this technique to postwar U.S. real GNP suggests that the periodic shift from a positive growth rate to a negative growth rate is a recurrent feature of the U.S. business cycle, and indeed could be used as an objective criterion for defining and measuring economic recessions. The estimated parameter values suggest that a typical economic recession is associated with a 3\%permanent drop in the level of GNP.},

The trade-oﬀ between both types of errors is computed, analyzed, and interpreted. Moreover, a new index, the dynamic mean absolute error, DMAE, is deﬁned to measure the prediction accuracy. This index accounts for both error components: temporal and absolute. Real cases of wind energy forecasting are used to illustrate the use of the new DMAE index and show the advantages of this new index over other error indices.},

	abstract = {Availability of day-ahead production forecast is an important step towards better dispatchability of wind power production. However, the stochastic nature of forecast errors prevents a wind farm operator from holding a firm production commitment. In order to mitigate the deviation from the commitment, an energy storage system connected to the wind farm is considered. One statistical characteristic of day-ahead forecast errors has a major impact on storage performance: errors are significantly correlated along several hours. We thus use a data-fitted autoregressive model that captures this correlation to quantify the impact of correlation on storage sizing. With a Monte Carlo approach, we study the behavior and the performance of an energy storage system (ESS) using the autoregressive model as an input. The ability of the storage system to meet a production commitment is statistically assessed for a range of capacities, using a mean absolute deviation criterion. By parametrically varying the correlation level, we show that disregarding correlation can lead to an underes- timation of a storage capacity by an order of magnitude. Finally, we compare the results obtained from the model and from field data to validate the model.},

	abstract = {Model-based clustering is a popular tool which is renowned for its probabilistic foundations and its ﬂexibility. However, high-dimensional data are nowadays more and more frequent and, unfortunately, classical model-based clustering techniques show a disappointing behavior in high-dimensional spaces. This is mainly due to the fact that model-based clustering methods are dramatically over-parametrized in this case. However, high-dimensional spaces have speciﬁc characteristics which are useful for clustering and recent techniques exploit those characteristics. After having recalled the bases of model-based clustering, this article will review dimension reduction approaches, regularization-based techniques, parsimonious modeling, subspace clustering methods and clustering methods based on variable selection. Existing softwares for model-based clustering of high-dimensional data will be also reviewed and their practical use will be illustrated on real-world data sets.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a ﬁrst-order autoregressive algorithm used to generate real-time (RT), hour-ahead (HA) and day-ahead (DA) wind and load forecast errors in time series. The modeled error time series preserve the characteristics of the historical forecast data sets. Four statistical characteristics are considered: the means, the standard deviations, the autocorrelations and the cross-correlations. A stochastic optimization routine was used to ﬁnd an optimal set of parameters that minimize the differences of the four characteristics between the generated error series and the targeted ones. The obtained parameters were then in due order of succession used to produce the RT, HA and DA forecasts. This method, although implemented as a ﬁrst-order regressive random forecast error generator, can be extended to higher orders. Simulation results have shown that the methodology produces random forecast error series that have statistics similar to those derived from real data sets. The wind and load forecast error generator can be used in wind integration studies to produce wind and load forecast in time series for stochastic planning processes. Our future studies will focus on reﬂecting the diurnal and seasonal differences of the wind and load statistics and on implementing them in the random forecast generator.

	abstract = {Due to the inherent stochastic and intermittent nature of wind generation, it is very diﬃcult to sharply improve the wind power forecasting accuracy. The sizing of energy storage system (ESS) for wind farm can eﬀectively reduce the uncertainty caused by the inevitable forecast error of wind power. However, optimal sizing of ESS is a multi-period decision-making problem and it is the key point that exactly captures the variation magnitude and speed of forecast error. This paper proposes a method to establish the multivariate joint cumulative distribution function (JCDF) of hourly day-ahead short-term multi-period forecast errors using Normal/t copula. Based on the proposed JCDF and multiple scenarios technique, a model of optimal sizing of ESS is proposed in which the temporal correlation relationship between diﬀerent time period forecast errors and probability distribution of each time period forecast error are both considered. The simulation results verify the eﬀectiveness of the proposed methods and show that if the temporal correlation of wind power short-term forecast error is ignored, the rated energy and power capacity of sizing of ESS will be signiﬁcantly misestimated.},

	abstract = {As penetrations of renewable wind energy increase, accurate short-term predictions of wind power become crucial to utilities that must balance the load and supply of electricity. As storage of wind energy is not yet feasible on a large scale, the utility must integrate wind energy as soon as it is generated and decide at each balancing time-step whether a change in conventional energy output is required. With high penetrations of wind energy, utilities must also plan for operating reserves to maintain stability of the electricity system when forecasts for renewable energy are inaccurate. Thus, a simple forecast of whether the wind power will increase, decrease or not change in the next time-step will give utility operators an easy tool for assessing whether changes need to be made to the current generation mix. In this work, Markov chain models based on the change in power output at up to three locations or lags in time are presented that not only produce such an hourly forecast but also include a measure of the uncertainty of the forecast. Forecasts are greatly improved when knowledge of whether the maximum or minimum wind power is currently being produced and the intrahour trend in wind power are incorporated. These models are trained, tested and evaluated with a uniquely long set of 2 years of 10 min measurements at four meteorological stations in the Paciﬁc Northwest and perform better than a benchmark state-of-the-art wind speed forecasting model.

	abstract = {Wind power production data at temporal resolutions of a few minutes exhibits successive periods with ﬂuctuations of various dynamic nature and magnitude, which cannot be explained (so far) by the evolution of some explanatory variable. Our proposal is to capture this regime-switching behaviour with an approach relying on Markov-Switching AutoRegressive (MSAR) models. An appropriate parameterization of the model coefﬁcients is introduced, along with an adaptive estimation method allowing to accommodate long-term variations in the process characteristics. The objective criterion to be recursively optimized is based on penalized maximum-likelihood, with exponential forgetting of past observations. MSAR models are then employed for 1-step-ahead point forecasting of 10-minute resolution time-series of wind power at two large offshore wind farms. They are favourably compared against persistence and AutoRegressive (AR) models. It is ﬁnally shown that the main interest of MSAR models lies in their ability to generate interval/density forecasts of signiﬁcantly higher skill.},
